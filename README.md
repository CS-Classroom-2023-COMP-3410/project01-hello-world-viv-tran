Hello GitHub Classroom
---

**Objective**:

1. Show that you have joined our GitHub classroom, and that you can access, modify, and submit assignments.
2. Show that you can use the web browser developer tools to inspect a webpage, and find elements within the HTML structure.

---

**Requirements**:

1. Create a file in this repository called `hello.md` and fill it with some text (any text you want).
2. Use the browser dev tools to find a particular link tag hidden in a website:
    - Go to the following URL: [https://cs.du.edu/~andhannu/](https://cs.du.edu/~andhannu/) 
    - Somewhere inside the HTML there is a tag that contains a hidden key.
    - The key is not actually visible on the page, but you should be able to find it just by looking at the HTML.
    - Create a file in this repository called `hidden-key.md` and inside of it copy/paste the entire tag that you find. (i.e. the entire line that looks like `<div ... > ... </div>`).
---

**Submission Instructions**:

- Submit the repository with the two newly created files as normal to GitHub classroom.

**Assessment**:

1. This is an all-or-nothing completion grade.
